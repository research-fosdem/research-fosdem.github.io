# <span style="color: #009926;">Saturday 5th of February 2022</span>

[**Attend online and chat**](https://chat.fosdem.org/#/room/#research:fosdem.org) or with [just the video](https://live.fosdem.org/watch/dresearch).

<!--
We invite **developers and users of open tools and technologies** used in a research and investigation context to contribute to the 2022 edition of [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org), the largest open-source conference in Europe.
We understand research as the general process of knowledge production and inquiry. This includes **scientific research, investigative journalism, data journalism, as well as research and investigations undertaken by NGOs, civil society, community and activist groups**, etc.

We seek talks about:
* **New releases of open source software**. Introduce a new tool or infrastructure about knowledge production or management. We appreciate context about the project, at the crossroads of open source software and open science.
* Present and/or ask for feedback on **open technology stacks** used in a knowledge creation or production project (research, journalistic inquiry, archive creation or publicationâ€¦) which collects, analyses, treats, documents, visualizes, and/or shares data.
* Discuss **tool design and implementation** that enhance the understanding and literacy of inquiry outputs: data visualisation techniques and issues, knowledge access and exploration means. E.g., how to hold an algorithm accountable to social scientists; how to foster better reproducibility and interoperability thanks to FLOSS; or how to cope with biases of a chart for a data journalist.
* Contribute to the debate about **bridging tech culture with research and investigative environments** (data journalism, investigative journalism, activism and academia), including tips and best practices for navigating tensions, as well as the contribution of the open source movement to research and investigations sustainability through organizational hosting, funding for projects, support and maintenance, etc.)
* Share your experience about building open source devices or communities across a variety of research and investigative contexts.

We welcome talks from various research and investigative contexts: research labs, libraries, newsrooms, museums, hackerspaces, maker labs, community and activist groups. We welcome your experience on various topics: open science, open data, commons, research on research, sustainability... Any subjects related to open source technologies in research contexts are welcome even if not in this list.

You will find a summary of what happened in our devroom the last two years in this blog post: https://reticular.hypotheses.org/1825

## Event and talks format

#### 1. Talks
- *Talks* will last *19 minutes max + 5-10 minutes Q&A*. 
- *Lightning talks* will last *14 minutes max* and will have shared panel 15 minutes Q&A.

Talks have to be *in English* and have to be pre-recorded in January 2022.
The video will be published under Creative Commons CC-BY licence on the [FOSDEM video recordings archive](https://video.fosdem.org/).

#### 2. Event format

The online event is the broadcasting of **a series of pre-recorded video talks**. A chatroom is available all along the event. After each talk video ends (20 minutes), speakers are invited to join a live Q&A session: a video conference room in which one moderator ask the speakers questions that the audience have posted in the event chatroom (5/10 minutes). This discussion is broadcast live to the audience.
The event can also propose panels of *lightning talks*. A panel is **a series of lightning talks**lasting 15 minutes each. The panel ends with a 15-minutes live Q&A session which set up a discussion between the panel's speakers fuelled by questions from the audience chatroom. 

# HOW TO SUBMIT

#### 1. Important dates:
- **Proposal Deadline: <span style="color: #900;">23rd Dec</span> 2021 23:59 CET**<br>*(we extended the deadline)*
- **Accepted talk announced: 31st Dec 2021 at the latest** 
- **Accepted Talk video upload Deadline: 15th Jan 2022 23:59 CET**
- **Online conference with live Q&A: 5th Feb 2022**
- Submit early if you can, as we will evaluate the proposals as they come because of the very tight schedule

#### 2. Submissions must include:
- Abstract
- Session type *(Lecture or Lightning Talk)*
- Expected prior knowledge / intended audience
- Speaker bio
- Links to code / slides / material for the talk *(optional)*
- Links to previous talks by the speaker *(optional)*

To get inspired on possible abstracts style, length and format, you can read previous edition talks on FOSDEM archives:

- [Open Research @ FOSDEM 2021](https://archive.fosdem.org/2021/schedule/track/open_research_tools_and_technologies/)
- [Open Research @ FOSDEM 2020](https://archive.fosdem.org/2020/schedule/track/open_research_tools_and_technologies/)
    
#### 3. Pentabarf tips (submission system)

Submission process is managed in the Pentabarf system used by the FOSDEM conference.

Apply for a talk: [https://penta.fosdem.org/submission/FOSDEM22](https://penta.fosdem.org/submission/FOSDEM22)

**By submitting your recorded talk you agree to have it made available publicly... forever.** 

When submitting your talk in Pentabarf, make sure to select the â€˜Open Research Tools and Technologies Devroomâ€™ as the â€˜Trackâ€™.
If you already have a Pentabarf account from a previous FOSDEM event, please reuse it. Create an account if, and only if, you donâ€™t have one from a previous year.

# The Open Research Technologies devroom

The Open Research Technologies devroom addresses [FLOSS](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/floss-and-foss.en.html) developers in a broad community concerned with research production and curation: scientists, engineers, journalists, archivists, curators, activists.
The tools and technologies targeted are typically creating, handling or sharing knowledge artifacts: data, academic papers, books, collections, web contents, algorithms, artworks.
This devroom provides a place and time to discuss the issues related to the creation and usage of open research technologies, with the ambition to foster discussions between designers, developers and users, bridging multiple knowledge-based communities together, and with the broader FLOSS community.

The Open Research Technologies devroom aims to:
- Allow knowledge-based tool developers to publicize their effort and become aware of other FLOSS projects.
- Facilitate the pooling of coding efforts on (often poorly funded) tools.
- Create a network where otherwise isolated developers, research engineers can share common FLOSS concerns.
- Provide social recognition for people who work in fields where designing and developing tools is less considered than usual outcomes (e.g. not publishing papers in research, not writing investigation in data journalism, etc).

# What is the FOSDEM?

The FOSDEM (Free and Open source Software Developers' European Meeting) is a non-commercial, volunteer-organized European event centered on free and open-source software development. It is aimed at developers and anyone interested in the free and open-source software movement. It aims to enable developers to meet and to promote the awareness and use of free and open-source software.
